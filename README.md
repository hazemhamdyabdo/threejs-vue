# 🎯 Three.js with Vue – Learning Playground

This repository is a personal learning playground for mastering [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) using [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/).  
Every new concept or feature is implemented in an isolated route/page, making it easy to focus, iterate, and revisit specific topics.

---

## 🧠 Objectives

- Learn Three.js from scratch using native API (not wrappers)
- Build practical, visual demos for each key concept
- Maintain a modular and scalable codebase using Vue 3 + Vite
- Improve 3D performance awareness and integration techniques
- Document my 3D learning journey step by step

---

## 🧱 Stack

- [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/) – Application structure and routing
- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) – Core 3D rendering engine
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) – Fast dev server & build tool
- [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/) – Page-based navigation
